## Positivity Assumption
The third assumption is called positivity assumption. Precisely, the probability of subjects being assigned to each treatment level must be positive. This is called the **positivity assumption**.

In marginally randomized studies, this assumption is satisfied by the design itself. Both P(A=1) and P(A=0) are greater than zero. In conditionally randomized studies, the assumption is also satisfied for each level of stratification. That is 
$$P(A=a \mid \boldsymbol{X}=\boldsymbol{x}) > 0 \text{, for all }\boldsymbol{x} \text{ with } P(\boldsymbol{X}=\boldsymbol{x}) > 0.$$

In observational studies, this assumptions can be violated, especially when the sample size is small. However, it is possible to validate this assumption empirically.
