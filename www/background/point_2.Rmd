## Point Exposure Studies (Cont'd)

#### Observational studies
In some cases, randomized studies might not be logistically practical or may even violate ethical standards. In these instances, we use observational studies. Unfortunately, in observational studies, the patient characteristics and treatment assignments are not under the control of the investigators. Due to the lack of a randomized mechanism for treatment assignment, it is hard to control confounding phenomena. As a result, some researchers are not confident in causal inferences drawn from observational studies.  Nevertheless, in the 1970's, Rubin extended the causal inference framework from randomized studies to observational studies under certain assumptions (described later).
